This list will be expanded once I wrap my head around what my plans and goals with this engine really are.

## Short term goals ##

  * Sophisticated dialogue system (again, take Zelda for example, only with the possibility of own answers and reactions by the NPC to them)
  * Basic UI, like a main menu

## Long term goals ##

  * Saving/loading the current state of the game (position, progress, global variables, etc.)
  * Live action combat system (take Zelda for example)
  * Various scripts (shop, steal, death, etc.) that developers can use in their games
  * Advanced UI, like inventory
